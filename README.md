# Nick Wolf Dotfiles

If you're me and you're looking to exactly replicate my system on a new system
you simply need to run

```
# curl -fsSL https://git.io/nickwolf-dotfiles | zsh
```

My dotfiles use a very eclectic set of tools.

For Dotfile managment I use [dotter](https://github.com/supercuber/dotter)

My fish plugin manager is [fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher)

My Package and program installer is [Brew](https://brew.sh/)

My Language version manager is [Mise](https://github.com/jdx/mise)

My Dotfiles are constantly evolving and I'm happy to hear suggestions or
receive pull requests if you think you have improvements on what to change.
