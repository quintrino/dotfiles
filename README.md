# Nick Wolf Dotfiles

If you're me and you're looking to exactly replicate my system on a new system
you simply need to run

```
# curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quintrino/dotfiles/master/deploy/deploy.sh | zsh
```

My dotfiles use a very eclectic set of tools.

For Dotfile managment I use [Fresh](https://github.com/freshshell/fresh)

My fish plugin manager is [fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher)

My Package and program installer is [Brew](https://brew.sh/)

My Language version manager is [ASDF](https://github.com/asdf-vm)

My Dotfiles are constantly evolving and I'm happy to hear suggestions or
receive pull requests if you think you have improvements on what to change
